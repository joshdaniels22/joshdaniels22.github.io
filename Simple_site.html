  <body>
    <main>
      Inside the "main" element is content that is specific to the current webpage. The content in main should not be in any other webpage. Things that are repeated like headers and footers should not be included in "main". "main" itself should not contain text. It contains further elements that contain text.
      <header>The "header" element contains the webpage's introductory information or heading and possibly some metadata that is relevant to the content, like the date and time of the post for example. It could also contain things like a table of contents for a longer document.
      </header>
      <article>
        This text is contained in an "article" element. It is used for things like blog posts or new articles as the name would suggest. It is used to contain content that could be distributed outside of the context of the webpage.
        <section>This text is contained in a "section" elemenet. These are used to separate different parts of the same post or article.
        </section>
        <aside>The "aside" element is used to provide information that is not actually part of the blog or post but is related to the article and may be considered useful to the reader>
        </aside>
      </article>
      <footer>The "footer" element contains infomation about the content like the author or copyright infomation or links to related websites.
        <address>The "address" element is used for the contact information of the author of the article. Not anyone's physical address as it is commonly mistaken for. It is often used within the footer. Contact <a href="mailto:jidk.daniels@example.com">Josh</a>
